# Data
Part of the instacart dataset is given in this repo. We have three files:
- ``trainu2b.txt``: \
  Each row is
  ``user_id, basket_id, basket_id, ...``
- ``trainb2i.txt``: \
  Each row is ``baset_id, item_id, item_id, ...``
- ``testb2i.txt``: \
  Each row is ``baset_id, item_id, item_id, ...``

The original data we use in the paper is too big to upload. You may find complete dataset of instacart [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)
